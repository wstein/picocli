/**
 * Checks a built {@link CommandSpec} tree for a picocli parsing ambiguity that's easy to
 * introduce by hand: an option's {@code defaultValue} that's textually identical to a sibling
 * subcommand's name. This is not a picocli bug -- the parser is being conservative about
 * genuinely ambiguous input -- but it fails unconditionally, on <em>every</em> invocation of the
 * command (confirmed empirically: even with zero arguments given, applying the default alone
 * throws {@code MissingParameterException}), so it's far better caught here than at first use.
 * <p>An earlier version of this check also flagged an unbounded-arity positional sibling to
 * subcommands, on the theory that it could "swallow" a subcommand name. That theory turned out
 * to be wrong: empirically, picocli correctly dispatches into a subcommand whose name appears as
 * a token even with such a positional active (with or without preceding positional values already
 * consumed) -- the real failure mode in the original flix example was simply positional
 * parameters declared on the wrong command level relative to where their values actually appear
 * in a real invocation, which is an ordinary structural mistake, not a subtle parsing ambiguity,
 * and isn't something this validator attempts to detect.</p>
